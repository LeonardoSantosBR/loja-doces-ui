# Social project for candy shop owners

I initially came up with this project idea to automate a sales notebook for the candy sales at my church. In this digital notebook, users can add the candies being sold each day and their quantities, with the total revenue automatically calculated.

I used libraries such as React, Tailwind CSS, React-Redux, React-Persist, Formik, and Lucide-React to build the project, which currently only has the front-end. I'm planning to develop a back-end for this application in the future.

Now it is not necessary to delete the candy to change some information, the pen button is possible to change the candy name and price

# New updates on Monday, February 3th
On the first day of testing I noticed the need to add quantities in batches, as often a customer asks for, for example, many candies at once, and for this the button to increase many quantities at once

# New updates on Tuesday, February 4th
I saw on the first day of testing that a security alert was necessary before finishing the store day, as it was very dangerous to accidentally press and reset all the data. I added an alert to confirm the action

# New updates on Saturday, February 8th
I created a PDF generator, listing all the sweets that were sold as soon as the store is finished by the user, a way to generate a report of the day
