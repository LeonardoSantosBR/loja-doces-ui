# 🍭 Social Project for Candy Shop Owners

I initially came up with this project idea to automate a sales notebook for the candy sales at my church. In this digital notebook, users can add the candies being sold each day and their quantities, with the total revenue automatically calculated.

I used libraries such as **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React-Redux**, **React-Persist**, **Formik**, and **Lucide-React** to build the project, which currently only has the front-end. I'm planning to develop a back-end for this application in the future.
